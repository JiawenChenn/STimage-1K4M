# STimage-1K4M Dataset

Welcome to the STimage-1K4M Dataset repository. This dataset is designed to foster research in the field of spatial transcriptomics, combining high-resolution histopathology images with detailed gene expression data. 

## Dataset Description

STimage-1K4M consists of 1,149 spatial transcriptomics slides, totaling over 4 million spots with paired gene expression data. This dataset includes:

- Images.
- Gene expression profiles matched with high-resolution histopathology images.
- Spatial coordinates for each spot.

See example folder for an example slide.
