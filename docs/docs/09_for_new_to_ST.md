This document aims to provide several resources for researchers new to ST field better understanding the technology and field.

Let's start from a nice introduction of the ST technologies.

Overall, ST data includes gene expression, spatial location and sometimes histology images. The integration of all these information facilitate the development of methods tailored for spatial transcriptomics data.

Here are several nice review papers:
- Moses, Lambda, and Lior Pachter. "Museum of spatial transcriptomics." Nature methods 19.5 (2022): 534-546.
- Coleman, K., Schroeder, A., & Li, M. (2024). Unlocking the power of spatial omics with AI. Nature Methods, 21(8), 1378-1381.
- Sza≈Çata, Artur, et al. "Transformers in single-cell omics: a review and new perspectives." Nature Methods 21.8 (2024): 1430-1443.
