Title 2: STmut: a framework for visualizing somatic alterations in spatial transcriptomics data of cancer.","Abstract 1: To define the cellular composition and architecture of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed ion beam imaging from a series of human cSCCs and matched normal skin. cSCC exhibited four tumor subpopulations, three recapitulating normal epidermal states, and a tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK) population unique to cancer, which localized to a fibrovascular niche. Integration of single-cell and spatial data mapped ligand-receptor networks to specific cell types, revealing TSK cells as a hub for intercellular communication. Multiple features of potential immunosuppression were observed, including T regulatory cell (Treg) co-localization with CD8 T cells in compartmentalized tumor stroma. Finally, single-cell characterization of human tumor xenografts and in vivo CRISPR screens identified essential roles for specific tumor subpopulation-enriched gene networks in tumorigenesis. These data define cSCC tumor and stromal cell subpopulations, the spatial niches where they interact, and the communicating gene networks that they engage in cancer. Abstract 2: Spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as the Visium platform, measure gene expression in different regions of tissues. Here, we describe new software, STmut, to visualize somatic point mutations, allelic imbalance, and copy number alterations in Visium data. STmut is tested on fresh-frozen Visium data, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) Visium data, and tumors with and without matching DNA sequencing data. Copy number is inferred on all conditions, but the chemistry of the FFPE platform does not permit analyses of single nucleotide variants. Taken together, we propose solutions to add the genetic dimension to spatial transcriptomic data and describe the limitations of different datatypes.","Keywords 1: CRISPR screen; MIBI; intra-tumoral heterogeneity; multi-omics; scRNA-seq; skin cancer; spatial transcriptomics; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor immunology; tumor microenvironment.

By integration with single cell data, we spatially map tumor-associated cell types to find tertiary lymphoid-like structures, and a type I interferon response overlapping with regions of T-cell and macrophage subset colocalization. We construct a predictive model to infer presence of tertiary lymphoid-like structures, applicable across tissue types and technical platforms. Taken together, we combine different data modalities to define a high resolution map of cellular interactions in tumors and provide tools generalizing across tissues and diseases.","","True","ST","510","14873"

Integration of single-cell and spatial data mapped ligand-receptor networks to specific cell types, revealing TSK cells as a hub for intercellular communication. Multiple features of potential immunosuppression were observed, including T regulatory cell (Treg) co-localization with CD8 T cells in compartmentalized tumor stroma. Finally, single-cell characterization of human tumor xenografts and in vivo CRISPR screens identified essential roles for specific tumor subpopulation-enriched gene networks in tumorigenesis.

Title 3: ScisorWiz: visualizing differential isoform expression in single-cell long-read data. Title 4: Accurate isoform discovery with IsoQuant using long reads.","Abstract 1: Splicing varies across brain regions, but the single-cell resolution of regional variation is unclear. We present a single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions using single-cell long-read sequencing in mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 ( www.isoformAtlas.com ). Isoform tests for DIE show better performance than exon tests. We detect hundreds of DIE events traceable to cell types, often corresponding to functionally distinct protein isoforms. Mostly, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. However, for fewer genes, multiple cell types influence DIE. Thus, regional identity can, although rarely, override cell-type specificity. Cell types indigenous to one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, e.g. the choroid plexus epithelium manifests distinct transcription-start-site usage. Spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing yield a spatially resolved splicing map. Our methods quantify isoform expression with cell-type and spatial resolution and it contributes to further our understanding of how the brain integrates molecular and cellular complexity. Abstract 2: Long-read transcriptomics require understanding error sources inherent to technologies. Current approaches cannot compare methods for an individual RNA molecule. Here, we present a novel platform-comparison method that combines barcoding strategies and long-read sequencing to sequence cDNA copies representing an individual RNA molecule on both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We compare these long-read pairs in terms of sequence content and isoform patterns. Although individual read pairs show high similarity, we find differences in (1) aligned length, (2) transcription start site (TSS), (3) polyadenylation site (poly(A)-site) assignment, and (4) exon-intron structures. Overall, 25% of read pairs disagree on either TSS, poly(A)-site, or splice site. Intron-chain disagreement typically arises from alignment errors of microexons and complicated splice sites. Our single-molecule technology comparison reveals that inconsistencies are often caused by sequencing error-induced inaccurate ONT alignments, especially to downstream GUNNGU donor motifs. However, annotation-disagreeing upstream shifts in NAGNAG acceptors in ONT are often confirmed by PacBio and are thus likely real. In both barcoded and nonbarcoded ONT reads, we find that intron number and proximity of GU/AGs better predict inconsistencies with the annotation than read quality alone. We summarize these findings in an annotation-based algorithm for spliced alignment correction that improves subsequent transcript construction with ONT reads. Abstract 3: Summary: RNA isoforms contribute to the diverse functionality of the proteins they encode within the cell. Visualizing how isoform expression differs across cell types and brain regions can inform our understanding of disease and gain or loss of functionality caused by alternative splicing with potential negative impacts. However, the extent to which this occurs in specific cell types and brain regions is largely unknown. This is the kind of information that ScisorWiz plots can provide in an informative and easily communicable manner. ScisorWiz affords its user the opportunity to visualize specific genes across any number of cell types, and provides various sorting options for the user to gain different ways to understand their data. ScisorWiz provides a clear picture of differential isoform expression through various clustering methods and highlights features such as alternative exons and single-nucleotide variants. Tools like ScisorWiz are key for interpreting single-cell isoform sequencing data. This tool applies to any single-cell long-read RNA sequencing data in any cell type, tissue or species.

Abstract 4: Annotating newly sequenced genomes and determining alternative isoforms from long-read RNA data are complex and incompletely solved problems.

For novel transcript discovery, IsoQuant reduces the false-positive rate fivefold and 2.5-fold for Oxford Nanopore reference-based or reference-free mode, respectively. IsoQuant also improves performance for Pacific Biosciences data. ","Keywords 1:  Keywords 2:  Keywords 3:  Keywords 4:","False","Visium","3024","31053"

To improve outcomes of VEGF therapy, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology to study the endothelial cells of the human diabetic skin. Single-cell suspensions were generated from the human skin followed by cDNA preparation using the Chromium Next GEM Single-cell 3' Kit v3.1. Using appropriate quality control measures, 36,487 cells were chosen for downstream analysis. scRNA-seq studies identified that although VEGF signaling was not significantly altered in diabetic versus nondiabetic skin, phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) was downregulated. The significance of PLCγ2 in VEGF-mediated increase in endothelial cell metabolism and function was assessed in cultured human microvascular endothelial cells. In these cells, VEGF enhanced mitochondrial function, as indicated by elevation in oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate. The VEGF-dependent increase in cell metabolism was blunted in response to PLCγ2 inhibition. Follow-up rescue studies therefore focused on understanding the significance of VEGF therapy in presence or absence of endothelial PLCγ2 in type 1 (streptozotocin-injected) and type 2 (db/db) diabetic ischemic tissue. Nonviral topical tissue nanotransfection technology (TNT) delivery of CDH5 promoter-driven PLCγ2 open reading frame promoted the rescue of hindlimb ischemia in diabetic mice. Improvement of blood flow was also associated with higher abundance of VWF+/CD31+ and VWF+/SMA+ immunohistochemical staining. TNT-based gene delivery was not associated with tissue edema, a commonly noted complication associated with proangiogenic gene therapies. Taken together, our study demonstrates that TNT-mediated delivery of endothelial PLCγ2, as part of combination gene therapy, is effective in diabetic ischemic limb rescue.","","False","Visium","2603","33538"

The use of spatial information has made it possible to discover new modes of gene expression regulations. However, in the ST experiment, the nucleus size of cells may exceed the thickness of a tissue slice.

Methods: Here, we defined the effect of Consecutive Slices Data Integration (CSDI) on unveiling accurate spot clustering and deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic spots in human postmortem brains. By considering the histological information as reference, we assessed the improvement of unsupervised clustering and single nuclei RNA-seq and ST data integration before and after CSDI.

Results: Apart from the escalated number of defined clusters representing neuronal layers, the pattern of clusters in consecutive sections was concordant only after CSDI. Besides, the assigned cell labels to spots matches the histological pattern of tissue sections after CSDI.

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the oncogene-induced gastric tumor progression, we have developed an organoid-based model of gastric cancer from GAstric Neoplasia (GAN) mice, which express Wnt1 and the enzymes COX2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 in the stomach. Both p53 knockout (GAN-p53KO) organoids and KRASG12V -expressing GAN-p53KO (GAN-KP) organoids were generated by genetic manipulation of GAN mouse-derived tumor (GAN wild-type [WT]) organoids. In contrast with GAN-WT and GAN-p53KO organoids, which manifested Wnt addiction, GAN-KP organoids showed a Wnt-independent phenotype and the ability to proliferate without formation of a Wnt-regulated three-dimensional epithelial architecture. After transplantation in syngeneic mouse stomach, GAN-p53KO cells formed only small tumors, whereas GAN-KP cells gave rise to invasive tumors associated with the development of hypoxia as well as to liver metastasis. Spatial transcriptomics analysis suggested that hypoxia signaling contributes to the metastatic progression of GAN-KP tumors. In particular, such analysis identified a cluster of stromal cells located at the tumor invasive front that expressed genes related to hypoxia signaling, angiogenesis, and cell migration. These cells were also positive for phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), suggesting that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling promotes development of both tumor and microenvironment. The MEK (MAPK kinase) inhibitor trametinib suppressed the development of GAN-KP gastric tumors, formation of a hypoxic microenvironment, tumor angiogenesis, and liver metastasis. Our findings therefore establish a rationale for application of trametinib to suppress metastatic progression of KRAS-mutated gastric cancer.","MEK; epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); gastric cancer; hypoxia; mouse model.","True","Visium","2429","31054"

At the time of spring tide, thousands of grass puffers (Takifugu alboplumbeus) aggregate and vigorously tremble their bodies at the water's edge to spawn. To understand the mechanisms underlying this spectacular semilunar beach spawning, we collected the hypothalamus and pituitary from male grass puffers every week for 2 months. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identified 125 semilunar genes, including genes crucial for reproduction (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 [gnrh1], luteinizing hormone β subunit [lhb]) and receptors for pheromone prostaglandin E (PGE). PGE2 is secreted into the seawater during the spawning, and its administration activates olfactory sensory neurons and triggers trembling behavior of surrounding individuals. These results suggest that PGE2 synchronizes lunar-regulated beach-spawning behavior in grass puffers. To further explore the mechanism that regulates the lunar-synchronized transcription of semilunar genes, we searched for semilunar transcription factors. Spatial transcriptomics and multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization showed co-localization of the semilunar transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (cebpd) and gnrh1, and cebpd induced the promoter activity of gnrh1. Taken together, our study demonstrates semilunar genes that mediate lunar-synchronized beach-spawning behavior.

Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis. Abstract 2: We recently identified a high-affinity C1q-ApoE complex in human artery atherosclerotic intima lesions and in human amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's Disease brains defining a common pathogenetic pathway of two diverse diseases, i.e. atherosclerosis and dementia. C1q is the initiating and controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC), which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form. Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex. We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing CCC activity. Here, we turned to the liver to examine C1q-ApoE complexes in human B- and C-viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, we used multidrug-resistance-2 gene-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice as a model for inflammatory liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. In normal murine and human livers, KCs were the major C1q-producing cell type while hepatocytes were the primary ApoE-forming cell type though the C1q-ApoE complex was rare or nonexistent. However, significant numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes formed in both Mdr2-KO, human viral hepatitis, and NAFLD around portal triads where immune cells had infiltrated the liver.

Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis. Abstract 2: We recently identified a high-affinity C1q-ApoE complex in human artery atherosclerotic intima lesions and in human amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's Disease brains defining a common pathogenetic pathway of two diverse diseases, i.e. atherosclerosis and dementia. C1q is the initiating and controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC), which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form. Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex. We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing CCC activity. Here, we turned to the liver to examine C1q-ApoE complexes in human B- and C-viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

C1q is the initiating and controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC), which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form. Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex. We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing CCC activity. Here, we turned to the liver to examine C1q-ApoE complexes in human B- and C-viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, we used multidrug-resistance-2 gene-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice as a model for inflammatory liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. In normal murine and human livers, KCs were the major C1q-producing cell type while hepatocytes were the primary ApoE-forming cell type though the C1q-ApoE complex was rare or nonexistent. However, significant numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes formed in both Mdr2-KO, human viral hepatitis, and NAFLD around portal triads where immune cells had infiltrated the liver. Additionally, high numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes emerged in human livers in areas of extracellular lipid droplets across the entire liver parenchyma in NAFLD-affected patients. Thus, the C1q-ApoE complex is a new pathological hallmark of viral hepatitis B and C and NAFLD.","Keywords 1: CITE-seq; Kupffer cell; NAFLD; across species; atlas; lipid-associated macrophage; liver; multi-omic; proteogenomic; spatial transcriptomics.

Discussion: Collectively, these data support a model of flare in chronic TNF-induced arthritis in which loss of lymphatic flow through affected joint-draining lymph nodes facilitates the interaction between effluxing macrophages and T-cells via ALCAM-CD6 co-stimulation, initiating IgG2b class-switching and plasma cell differentiation of the expanded Bin population.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this lymphatic dysfunction remain poorly understood. Herein, we utilized multi-omic spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to evaluate altered cellular composition (including lymphatic endothelial cells, macrophages, B-cells, and T-cells) in the joint-draining lymph node sinuses and their associated phenotypic changes and cell-cell interactions during RA development using the tumor necrosis factor transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model.

Methods: Popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs) from wild-type (n=10) and TNF-Tg male mice with """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Early"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (5 to 6-months of age; n=6) and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Advanced"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (>8-months of age; n=12) arthritis were harvested and processed for spatial transcriptomics. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed in PLNs from the TNF-Tg cohorts (n=6 PLNs pooled/cohort). PLN histopathology and ELISPOT along with ankle histology and micro-CT were evaluated. Histopathology of human lymph nodes and synovia was performed for clinical correlation.

Results: Advanced PLN sinuses exhibited an increased Ighg2b/Ighm expression ratio (Early 0.5 ± 0.1 vs Advanced 1.4 ± 0.5 counts/counts; p<0.001) that significantly correlated with reduced talus bone volumes in the afferent ankle (R2 = 0.54, p<0.001). Integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics revealed the increased IgG2b+ plasma cells localized in MARCO+ peri-follicular medullary sinuses. A concomitant decreased Fth1 expression (Early 2.5 ± 0.74 vs Advanced 1.0 ± 0.50 counts, p<0.001) within Advanced PLN sinuses was associated with accumulation of iron-laden Prussian blue positive macrophages in lymph nodes and synovium of Advanced TNF-Tg mice, and further validated in RA clinical samples.

Methods: Skin tissues examined for spatial gene expression were derived from the upper arm of 6 healthy control (HC) donors and 7 AD patients (lesion and nonlesion). We performed spatial transcriptomics sequencing to characterize the cellular infiltrate in lesional skin. For single-cell analysis, we analyzed the single-cell data from suction blister material from AD lesions and HC skin at the antecubital fossa skin (4 ADs and 5 HCs) and full-thickness skin biopsies (4 ADs and 2 HCs). The multiple proximity extension assays were performed in the serum samples from 36 AD patients and 28 HCs.

Results: The single-cell analysis identified unique clusters of fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the lesional AD skin. Spatial transcriptomics analysis showed the upregulation of COL6A5, COL4A1, TNC, and CCL19 in COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts in the leukocyte-infiltrated areas in AD skin. CCR7-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) showed a similar distribution in the lesions. Additionally, M2 macrophages expressed CCL13 and CCL18 in this area.

Results: The single-cell analysis identified unique clusters of fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the lesional AD skin. Spatial transcriptomics analysis showed the upregulation of COL6A5, COL4A1, TNC, and CCL19 in COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts in the leukocyte-infiltrated areas in AD skin. CCR7-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) showed a similar distribution in the lesions. Additionally, M2 macrophages expressed CCL13 and CCL18 in this area. Ligand-receptor interaction analysis of the spatial transcriptome identified neighboring infiltration and interaction between activated COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts, CCL13- and CCL18-expressing M2 macrophages, CCR7- and LAMP3-expressing DCs, and T cells. As observed in skin lesions, serum levels of TNC and CCL18 were significantly elevated in AD, and correlated with clinical disease severity.

Conclusion: In this study, we show the unknown cellular crosstalk in leukocyte-infiltrated area in lesional skin.

Results: At age 6 months, we found that the percent area of 6E10+ deposits and plaque-associated microglia in Inpp5d knockdown mice were increased compared to controls. Spatial transcriptomics identified a plaque-specific expression profile that was extensively altered by Inpp5d knockdown.

Discussion: These results demonstrate that conditional Inpp5d downregulation in the PSAPP mouse increases plaque burden and recruitment of microglia to plaques. Spatial transcriptomics highlighted an extended gene expression signature associated with plaques and identified CST7 (cystatin F) as a novel marker of plaques.

Highlights: Inpp5d knockdown increases plaque burden and plaque-associated microglia number. Spatial transcriptomics identifies an expanded plaque-specific gene expression profile.

Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from multiple human cancers and a mouse tumor transplant model to discover the pleiotropic expression of the Interleukin 7 (IL-7) receptor on T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

Results: Our experiment on the mouse model demonstrated that recombinant IL-7 therapy induces tumor regression, expansion of effector CD8 T cells, and pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages.

Despite the focal nature of mineral deposition in nephrolithiasis, we uncover a global injury signature characterized by immune activation, oxidative stress and extracellular matrix remodeling. We also identify the association of MMP7 and MMP9 expression with stone disease and mineral deposition, respectively. MMP7 and MMP9 are significantly increased in the urine of patients with CaOx stone disease, and their levels correlate with disease activity. Our results define the spatial molecular landscape and specific pathways contributing to stone-mediated injury in the human papilla and identify associated urinary biomarkers.","","False","Visium","939","36601"

Senescent cancer cells accumulate in CRC favoring tumor dissemination. Whether this mechanism progresses also in metastasis is unexplored. Here, we integrated spatial transcriptomics, 3D-microscopy, and multicellular transcriptomics to study the role of cellular senescence in human colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). We discovered two distinct senescent metastatic cancer cell (SMCC) subtypes, transcriptionally located at the opposite pole of epithelial (e) to mesenchymal (m) transition. SMCCs differ in chemotherapy susceptibility, biological program, and prognostic roles. Mechanistically, epithelial (e)SMCC initiation relies on nucleolar stress, whereby c-myc dependent oncogene hyperactivation induces ribosomal RPL11 accumulation and DNA damage response. In a 2D pre-clinical model, we demonstrated that RPL11 co-localized with HDM2, a p53-specific ubiquitin ligase, leading to senescence activation in (e)SMCCs. On the contrary, mesenchymal (m)SMCCs undergo TGFβ paracrine activation of NOX4-p15 effectors. SMCCs display opposing effects also in the immune regulation of neighboring cells, establishing an immunosuppressive environment or leading to an active immune workflow. Both SMCC signatures are predictive biomarkers whose unbalanced ratio determined the clinical outcome in CRLM and CRC patients.

Methods: hNSCs were transplanted into the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus using the 5XFAD mouse model. Spatial memory was assessed by Morris water maze. Amyloid plaque burden was quantified. Spatial transcriptomics was performed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified both globally and within the hippocampus.

Results: hNSC transplantation restored learning curves of 5XFAD mice. However, there were no changes in amyloid plaque burden. Spatial transcriptomics showed 1,061 DEGs normalized in hippocampal subregions. Plaque induced genes in microglia, along with populations of stage 1 and stage 2 disease associated microglia (DAM), were normalized upon hNSC transplantation.

Here, we used spatial transcriptomics to elucidate therapeutic mechanisms of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in an animal model of AD.

Methods: hNSCs were transplanted into the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus using the 5XFAD mouse model. Spatial memory was assessed by Morris water maze. Amyloid plaque burden was quantified. Spatial transcriptomics was performed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified both globally and within the hippocampus.

Furthermore, novel use of join count analysis demonstrated nonrandom directional spatial dependencies of the transcriptionally defined shared clusters, supporting a conserved spatio-transcriptional architecture in TNBC. These findings were substantiated in an independent validation cohort comprising 17,861 spatial features representing 15 samples from 8 patients. Stratification of samples by race revealed race-associated differences in hypoxic tumor content and regions of immune-rich infiltrate. Overall, this study combined spatial and functional molecular analyses to define the tumor architecture of TNBC, with potential implications in understanding TNBC disparities.

We identify mitogen-activated protein kinases as core kinases involved in transcriptional regulation by mediating the phosphorylation of chromatin remodeling proteins during early cardiogenesis. We construct the reciprocal regulatory network of transcription factors (TFs) and identify a series of TFs controlling early cardiogenesis involved in cycling-dependent proliferation.

We unveiled that existing bulk expression signatures of high-plasticity breast cancers are relevant in mesenchymal transdifferentiated compartments but can be hindered by abundant stromal cells in tumor samples, negatively impacting their clinical applicability. Spatial transcriptomic analyses constitute powerful tools to identify specific expression markers and could thus enhance diagnosis and clinical care of rare high-plasticity breast cancers.","diagnostic markers; integrative approaches; plasticity; rare subtypes; spatial transcriptomics.","True","Visium","2700","36601"

Insights into the mechanisms by which the stroma manipulates the immune microenvironment could help improve cancer treatment. Here, we aimed to elucidate potential approaches for stromal reprogramming and improved cancer immunotherapy. Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC) and D expression were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer, and PDGF receptor beta (PDGFRβ) was predominantly expressed in diffuse-type gastric cancer stroma. CAFs stimulated with PDGFs exhibited markedly increased expression of CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL8, which are involved in polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) recruitment. Fibrotic gastric cancer xenograft tumors exhibited increased PMN-MDSC accumulation and decreased lymphocyte infiltration, as well as resistance to anti-PD-1. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics revealed that PDGFRα/β blockade reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment through stromal modification. Finally, combining PDGFRα/β blockade and anti-PD-1 treatment synergistically suppressed the growth of fibrotic tumors.

We applied spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-sequencing on patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to profile spatially resolved cell populations within oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+ ) breast cancer and to elucidate their importance in oestrogen-dependent tumour growth.

Methods: Two PDXs of 'ER-high' breast cancers with opposite oestrogen-mediated growth responses were investigated: oestrogen-suppressed GS3 (80-100% ER) and oestrogen-dependent SC31 (40-90% ER) models. The observation was validated via single-cell analyses on an 'ER-low' PDX, GS1 (5% ER). The results from our spatial and single-cell analyses were further supported by a public ER+ breast cancer single-cell dataset and protein-based dual immunohistochemistry (IHC) of SC31 examining important luminal cancer markers (i.e., ER, progesterone receptor and Ki67). The translational implication of our findings was assessed by clinical outcome analyses on publicly available cohorts.

Results: Our space-gene-function study revealed four spatially distinct compartments within ER+ breast cancers. These compartments showed functional diversity (oestrogen-responsive, proliferative, hypoxia-induced and inflammation-related). The 'proliferative' population, rather than the 'oestrogen-responsive' compartment, was crucial for oestrogen-dependent tumour growth, leading to the acquisition of luminal B-like features. The cells expressing typical oestrogen-responsive genes like PGR were not directly linked to oestrogen-dependent proliferation. Dual IHC analyses demonstrated the distinct contribution of the Ki67+ proliferative cells toward oestrogen-mediated growth and their response to a CDK4/6 inhibitor. The gene signatures derived from the proliferative, hypoxia-induced and inflammation-related compartments were significantly correlated with worse clinical outcomes, while patients with the oestrogen-responsive signature showed better prognoses, suggesting that this compartment would not be directly associated with oestrogen-dependent tumour progression.

Conclusions: Our study identified the gene signature in our 'proliferative' compartment as an important determinant of luminal cancer subtypes.

Uncaria treatments increase sleep time and quality in humans, and RHY induces sleep in rats. However, like many traditional natural treatments, the mechanisms of action of RHY and Uncaria remain evasive. Moreover, it is unknown whether RHY modifies key brain oscillations during sleep. We thus aimed at defining the effects of RHY on sleep architecture and oscillations throughout a 24-h cycle, as well as identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mice received systemic RHY injections at two times of the day (beginning and end of the light period), and vigilance states were studied by electrocorticographic recordings.

Results: RHY enhanced slow wave sleep (SWS) after both injections, suppressed paradoxical sleep (PS) in the light but enhanced PS in the dark period. Furthermore, RHY modified brain oscillations during both wakefulness and SWS (including delta activity dynamics) in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, most effects were larger in females. A brain spatial transcriptomic analysis showed that RHY modifies the expression of genes linked to cell movement, apoptosis/necrosis, and transcription/translation in a brain region-independent manner, and changes those linked to sleep regulation (e.g., Hcrt, Pmch) in a brain region-specific manner (e.g., in the hypothalamus).

The terpenoid celastrol is a YAP1 inhibitor; however, if celastrol can alleviate SSc fibrosis is unknown. Moreover, the cell niches required for skin fibrosis are unknown.

Methods: Human dermal fibroblasts from healthy individuals and patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc were treated with or without transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), with or without celastrol. Mice were subjected to the bleomycin-induced model of skin SSc, in the presence or absence of celastrol. Fibrosis was assessed using RNA Sequencing, real-time PCR, spatial transcriptomic analyses, Western blot, ELISA and histological analyses.

Results: In dermal fibroblasts, celastrol impaired the ability of TGFβ1 to induce an SSc-like pattern of gene expression, including that of cellular communication network factor 2, collagen I and TGFβ1. Celastrol alleviated the persistent fibrotic phenotype of dermal fibroblasts cultured from lesions of SSc patients. In the bleomycin-induced model of skin SSc, increased expression of genes associated with reticular fibroblast and hippo/YAP clusters was observed; conversely, celastrol inhibited these bleomycin-induced changes and blocked nuclear localisation of YAP.

Methods: Human dermal fibroblasts from healthy individuals and patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc were treated with or without transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), with or without celastrol.

Fibrosis was assessed using RNA Sequencing, real-time PCR, spatial transcriptomic analyses, Western blot, ELISA and histological analyses.

Results: In dermal fibroblasts, celastrol impaired the ability of TGFβ1 to induce an SSc-like pattern of gene expression, including that of cellular communication network factor 2, collagen I and TGFβ1. Celastrol alleviated the persistent fibrotic phenotype of dermal fibroblasts cultured from lesions of SSc patients.

We apply direct RNA hybridization-based in situ sequencing (dRNA HybISS, Cartana part of 10xGenomics) to compare male and female healthy mouse kidneys and the male kidney injury and repair timecourse. A pre-selected panel of 200 genes is used to identify cell state dynamics patterns during injury and repair. We develop a new computational pipeline, CellScopes, for the rapid analysis, multi-omic integration and visualization of spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets. The resulting dataset allows us to resolve 13 kidney cell types within distinct kidney niches, dynamic alterations in cell state over the course of injury and repair and cell-cell interactions between leukocytes and kidney parenchyma. At late timepoints after injury, C3+ leukocytes are enriched near pro-inflammatory, failed-repair proximal tubule cells. Integration of snRNA-seq dataset from the same injury and repair samples also allows us to impute the spatial localization of genes not directly measured by dRNA HybISS.","","False","Visium","1815","32285"

Traditional management of lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (LGACC) involves the removal of the eye and surrounding socket contents, followed by chemoradiation. Even with this radical treatment, the 10-year survival rate for LGACC is 20% given the propensity for recurrence and metastasis. Due to the rarity of LGACC, its pathobiology is not well-understood, leading to difficulties in diagnosis, treatment, and effective management. Here, we integrate bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to identify a specific LGACC gene signature that can inform novel targeted therapies. Of the 3499 differentially expressed genes identified by bulk RNA-seq, the results of our spatial transcriptomic analysis reveal 15 upregulated and 12 downregulated genes that specifically arise from LGACC cells, whereas fibroblasts, reactive fibrotic tissue, and nervous and skeletal muscle account for the remaining bulk RNA-seq signature. In light of the analysis, we identified a transitional state cell or stem cell cluster. The results of the pathway analysis identified the upregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling, IL-17 signaling, and multiple other cancer pathways. This study provides insights into the molecular and cellular landscape of LGACC, which can inform new, targeted therapies to improve patient outcomes.","lacrimal gland adenoid cystic carcinoma; rare cancer; spatial transcriptomics; transcriptomic signature.","True","Visium","3584","17943"

The most common subtype of IPMNs harbors a gastric foveolar-type epithelium, and these low-grade mucinous neoplasms are harbingers of IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia and cancer. The molecular underpinning of gastric differentiation in IPMNs is unknown, although identifying drivers of this indolent phenotype might enable opportunities for intercepting progression to high-grade IPMN and cancer. We conducted spatial transcriptomics on a cohort of IPMNs, followed by orthogonal and cross-species validation studies, which established the transcription factor NKX6-2 as a key determinant of gastric cell identity in low-grade IPMNs. Loss of NKX6-2 expression is a consistent feature of IPMN progression, while reexpression of Nkx6-2 in murine IPMN lines recapitulates the aforementioned gastric transcriptional program and glandular morphology. Our study identifies NKX6-2 as a previously unknown transcription factor driving indolent gastric differentiation in IPMN pathogenesis.

Significance: Identification of the molecular features driving IPMN development and differentiation is critical to prevent cancer progression and enhance risk stratification. We used spatial profiling to characterize the epithelium and microenvironment of IPMN, which revealed a previously unknown link between NKX6-2 and gastric differentiation, the latter associated with indolent biological potential.

Spatial transcriptomics in normal and ischemic mouse kidney tissue showed a localized cluster of T cells in the outer medulla expressing DN T cell genes including Fcer1g. These results provide a template for future studies in DN T as well as CD4+ and CD8+ cells in normal and diseased kidneys.","","False","Visium","2613","32285"

We aimed to generate a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver using multi-omic modalities and protein-based functional validation.

Methods: We employed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (47,156 cells and 23,000 nuclei) and spatial transcriptomics (one sample by 10x Visium and five samples with Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to profile the cellular ecosystem in 10 PSC livers. Transcriptomic profiles were compared to 24 neurologically deceased donor livers (107,542 cells) and spatial transcriptomics controls, as well as 18,240 cells and 20,202 nuclei from three PBC livers. Flow cytometry was performed to validate PSC-specific differences in immune cell phenotype and function.

Results: PSC explants with parenchymal cirrhosis and prominent periductal fibrosis contained a population of cholangiocyte-like hepatocytes that were surrounded by diverse immune cell populations. PSC-associated biliary, mesenchymal, and endothelial populations expressed chemokine and cytokine transcripts involved in immune cell recruitment. Additionally, expanded CD4+ T cells and recruited myeloid populations in the PSC liver expressed the corresponding receptors to these chemokines and cytokines, suggesting potential recruitment. Tissue-resident macrophages, by contrast, were reduced in number and exhibited a dysfunctional and downregulated inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ stimulation.

Conclusions: We present a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver and demonstrate an exhaustion-like phenotype of myeloid cells and markers of chronic cytokine expression in late-stage PSC lesions. This atlas expands our understanding of the cellular complexity of PSC and has potential to guide the development of novel treatments.

Impact and implications: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare liver disease characterized by chronic inflammation and irreparable damage to the bile ducts, which eventually results in liver failure. Due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of disease, treatment options are limited. To address this, we sequenced healthy and diseased livers to compare the activity, interactions, and localization of immune and non-immune cells. This revealed that hepatocytes lining PSC scar regions co-express cholangiocyte markers, whereas immune cells infiltrate the scar lesions. Of these cells, macrophages, which typically contribute to tissue repair, were enriched in immunoregulatory genes and demonstrated a lack of responsiveness to stimulation. These cells may be involved in maintaining hepatic inflammation and could be a target for novel therapies.","Liver; Myeloid Dysfunction; Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis; Single Cell RNA sequencing; Spatial Transcriptomics.","False","Visium","2378","36601"

Methods: Phenotypic clonality can be detected by X-chromosome inactivation patterns. We investigated whether clones of SMCs exist in unstable human atheroma using RNA in situ hybridization (BaseScope) to identify a naturally occurring 24-nucleotide deletion in the 3'UTR of the X-linked BGN (biglycan) gene, a proteoglycan highly expressed by SMCs. BGN-specific BaseScope probes were designed to target the wild-type or deletion mRNA. Three different coronary artery plaque types (erosion, rupture, and adaptive intimal thickening) were selected from heterozygous females for the deletion BGN. Hybridization of target RNA-specific probes was used to visualize the spatial distribution of mutants. A clonality index was calculated from the percentage of each probe in each region of interest. Spatial transcriptomics were used to identify differentially expressed transcripts within clonal and nonclonal regions.

Results: Less than one-half of regions of interest in the intimal plaque were considered clonal with the mean percent regions of interest with clonality higher in the intimal plaque than in the media. This was consistent for all plaque types. The relationship of the dominant clone in the intimal plaque and media showed significant concordance. In comparison with the nonclonal lesions, the regions with SMC clonality had lower expression of genes encoding cell growth suppressors such as CD74, SERF-2 (small EDRK-rich factor 2), CTSB (cathepsin B), and HLA-DPA1 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha 1), among others.

Conclusions: Our novel approach to examine clonality suggests atherosclerosis is primarily a disease of polyclonally and to a lesser extent clonally expanded SMCs and may have implications for the development of antiatherosclerotic therapies.","atherosclerosis; biglycan; coronary artery disease; gene expression; pathology.","False","Visium","2615","17943"

Paradoxically, the presence of AER in the axolotl, a primary model organism for regeneration, remains controversial. Here, by leveraging a single-cell transcriptomics-based multi-species atlas, composed of axolotl, human, mouse, chicken, and frog cells, we first establish that axolotls contain cells with AER characteristics. Further analyses and spatial transcriptomics reveal that axolotl limbs do not fully re-form AER cells during regeneration. Moreover, the axolotl mesoderm displays part of the AER machinery, revealing a program for limb (re)growth. These results clarify the debate about the axolotl AER and the extent to which the limb developmental program is recapitulated during regeneration.","","False","Visium","1089","99088"

The form with symptomatic muscular involvement is called muscular sarcoidosis. The impact of immune cells composing the granuloma on the skeletal muscle is misunderstood. Here, we investigated the granuloma-skeletal muscle interactions through spatial transcriptomics on two patients affected by muscular sarcoidosis. Five major transcriptomic clusters corresponding to perigranuloma, granuloma, and three successive muscle tissue areas (proximal, intermediate, and distal) around the granuloma were identified. Analyses revealed upregulated pathways in the granuloma corresponding to the activation of T-lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages cytokines, the upregulation of extracellular matrix signatures, and the induction of the TGF-β signaling in the perigranuloma. A comparison between the proximal and distal muscles to the granuloma revealed an inverse correlation between the distance to the granuloma and the upregulation of cellular response to interferon-γ/α, TNF-α, IL-1,4,6, fibroblast proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition, and the downregulation of muscle gene expression. These data shed light on the intercommunications between granulomas and the muscle tissue and provide pathophysiological mechanisms by showing that granuloma immune cells have a direct impact on proximal muscle tissue by promoting its progressive replacement by fibrosis via the expression of pro-inflammatory and profibrosing signatures.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether transcriptionally active HBV integration events spread throughout the liver tissue in different phases of chronic HBV infection, especially in patients with HBsAg loss.

Design: We constructed high-resolution spatial transcriptomes of liver biopsies containing 13 059 tissue spots from 18 patients with chronic HBV infection to analyse the occurrence and relative distribution of transcriptionally active viral integration events. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of HBsAg and HBV core antigen. Intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels were quantified by real-time qPCR.

Results: Spatial transcriptome sequencing identified the presence of 13 154 virus-host chimeric reads in 7.86% (1026 of 13 059) of liver tissue spots in all patients, including three patients with HBsAg loss. These HBV integration sites were randomly distributed on chromosomes and can localise in host genes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, such as ALB, CLU and APOB. Patients who were receiving or had received antiviral treatment had a significantly lower percentage of viral integration-containing spots and significantly fewer chimeric reads than treatment-naïve patients. Intrahepatic cccDNA levels correlated well with viral integration events.

Conclusion: Transcriptionally active HBV integration occurred in chronically HBV-infected patients at different phases, including in patients with HBsAg loss.

We aimed to generate a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver using multi-omic modalities and protein-based functional validation.

Methods: We employed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (47,156 cells and 23,000 nuclei) and spatial transcriptomics (one sample by 10x Visium and five samples with Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to profile the cellular ecosystem in 10 PSC livers. Transcriptomic profiles were compared to 24 neurologically deceased donor livers (107,542 cells) and spatial transcriptomics controls, as well as 18,240 cells and 20,202 nuclei from three PBC livers. Flow cytometry was performed to validate PSC-specific differences in immune cell phenotype and function.

Results: PSC explants with parenchymal cirrhosis and prominent periductal fibrosis contained a population of cholangiocyte-like hepatocytes that were surrounded by diverse immune cell populations. PSC-associated biliary, mesenchymal, and endothelial populations expressed chemokine and cytokine transcripts involved in immune cell recruitment. Additionally, expanded CD4+ T cells and recruited myeloid populations in the PSC liver expressed the corresponding receptors to these chemokines and cytokines, suggesting potential recruitment. Tissue-resident macrophages, by contrast, were reduced in number and exhibited a dysfunctional and downregulated inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ stimulation.

Conclusions: We present a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver and demonstrate an exhaustion-like phenotype of myeloid cells and markers of chronic cytokine expression in late-stage PSC lesions. This atlas expands our understanding of the cellular complexity of PSC and has potential to guide the development of novel treatments.

Due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of disease, treatment options are limited. To address this, we sequenced healthy and diseased livers to compare the activity, interactions, and localization of immune and non-immune cells. This revealed that hepatocytes lining PSC scar regions co-express cholangiocyte markers, whereas immune cells infiltrate the scar lesions.

We aimed to generate a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver using multi-omic modalities and protein-based functional validation.

Methods: We employed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (47,156 cells and 23,000 nuclei) and spatial transcriptomics (one sample by 10x Visium and five samples with Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to profile the cellular ecosystem in 10 PSC livers. Transcriptomic profiles were compared to 24 neurologically deceased donor livers (107,542 cells) and spatial transcriptomics controls, as well as 18,240 cells and 20,202 nuclei from three PBC livers. Flow cytometry was performed to validate PSC-specific differences in immune cell phenotype and function.

Results: PSC explants with parenchymal cirrhosis and prominent periductal fibrosis contained a population of cholangiocyte-like hepatocytes that were surrounded by diverse immune cell populations. PSC-associated biliary, mesenchymal, and endothelial populations expressed chemokine and cytokine transcripts involved in immune cell recruitment. Additionally, expanded CD4+ T cells and recruited myeloid populations in the PSC liver expressed the corresponding receptors to these chemokines and cytokines, suggesting potential recruitment. Tissue-resident macrophages, by contrast, were reduced in number and exhibited a dysfunctional and downregulated inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ stimulation.

Conclusions: We present a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver and demonstrate an exhaustion-like phenotype of myeloid cells and markers of chronic cytokine expression in late-stage PSC lesions. This atlas expands our understanding of the cellular complexity of PSC and has potential to guide the development of novel treatments.

Impact and implications: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare liver disease characterized by chronic inflammation and irreparable damage to the bile ducts, which eventually results in liver failure. Due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of disease, treatment options are limited. To address this, we sequenced healthy and diseased livers to compare the activity, interactions, and localization of immune and non-immune cells.

Macrophages (Mϕ) hold promise as prognostic classifiers and therapeutic targets. Here, stemming from a single-cell analysis of mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating human CLM, we identified two Mϕ markers associated with distinct populations with opposite clinical relevance. The invasive margin of CLM was enriched in pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived Mϕ (MoMϕ) expressing the monocytic marker SERPINB2, and a more differentiated population, tumor-associated Mϕ (TAM), expressing glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB). SERPINB2+ MoMϕ had an early inflammatory profile, whereas GPNMB+ TAMs were enriched in pathways of matrix degradation, angiogenesis, and lipid metabolism and were found closer to the tumor margin, as confirmed by spatial transcriptomics on CLM specimens. In a cohort of patients, a high infiltration of SERPINB2+ cells independently associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS; P = 0.033), whereas a high density of GPNMB+ cells correlated with shorter DFS (P = 0.012) and overall survival (P = 0.002). Cell-cell interaction analysis defined opposing roles for MoMϕ and TAMs, suggesting that SERPINB2+ and GPNMB+ cells are discrete populations of Mϕ and may be exploited for further translation to an immune-based stratification tool. This study provides evidence of how multi-omics approaches can identify nonredundant, clinically relevant markers for further translation to immune-based patient stratification tools and therapeutic targets. GPNMB has been shown to set Mϕ in an immunosuppressive mode. Our high dimensional analyses provide further evidence that GPNMB is a negative prognostic indicator and a potential player in the protumor function of Mϕ populations.","","True","Visium","4160","17943"
